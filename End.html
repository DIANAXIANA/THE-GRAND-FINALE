      <p>We have finally reached my favorite time of the semester, which is THE END. Thank you kind sir for being patient with my un-organized, tardy self. I wish that you have more thrilling and organized students in the following semesters that follow. You were an amazing instructor, and I wish you a very good summer! </p>
