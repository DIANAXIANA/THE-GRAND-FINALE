      <h1>My Excuse</h1>
      <p>I am in California visiting my grandparents and currently It is 2am on May 10th. Was it the smartest idea to take a last minute trip during the final weeks of school knowing very well I have some assignments to turn in? No, It was not. But, the opportunity came up, and since I had the health and finances to do so, I chose to come. Also, this could potentially be the last time that I am able to see my grandparents, since they are a bit advanced in age. I understand that this is not a valid excuse for tardiness what-so-ever, but this is currently my situatuion. I am just thankful I have hotspot on my phone because my grandparents are boomers and they do not have wifi. </p>
